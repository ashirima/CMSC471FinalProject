            <h2>The Gap in Wealth Ownership</h2>

            <p>Each of these squares represents one household in America by the racial identity of those living in the household</p>
            <div id="squares"></div>

            <p id="black-breakdown">As we add more squares we start to build the racial breakdown of households in America. In 2024, Black Americans made up 11% of the households in America</p>
            <div id="racial-breakdown"></div>


            <p>In a perfect world each household would have an equal amount of wealth held from America's economy. This would look something like this...</p>
            <div id="equal-breakdown"></div>

            <p>However, we don't live in a perfect world. Wealth is unequally distributed to the population putting Black Americans at a severe
                disadvantage when it comes to generational wealth. In reality some races hold more wealth than propoptional to their population. The distribution of wealth looks more like this...</p>
            <div id="unequal-breakdown"></div>

            
            <p>Black Americans have and are facing economic disparities when it comes to generational wealth. There is evidence
                of trends showing that Black Americans don't own wealth proportional to their population numbers. We can see
                evidence of this in the below graphics. On the left side is race population breakdown by houeshold. On the 
                right side is the race breakdown by household of wealth ownership. Click on the dropdown
                menus to discover the changes in wealth ownership between years and between assets. (add source for data)

                <h2>The Gap in Graduation Rates and its Impact on Occupation Employment</h2>
                
                <p>In many cases, higher paying professional careers are obtained by pursuing higher education. However, Black people generally have less access
                  to higher education, which causes them to be underrepresented in higher paying fields. Below is a piechart that shows the breakdown of
                  education attainment by race in adults aged 25 and older. Compared to their White and Asian counterparts, Black people are less likely to receive
                  some sort of college degree.
                </p>

                <div class="select">
                  <select id="selectRace">
                    <option value="Select Race">Select Race</option>
                    <option value="White">White</option>
                    <option value="Black">Black</option>
                    <option value="Hispanic">Hispanic</option>
                    <option value="Asian">Asian</option>

              <br>


              <p>With less Black Americans graduating in higher education, we then see a trend in the types of employment 
                Black Americans are hired in. The following visual describes the under and overrepresentation of Black, White,
                Asian, and Hispanic Americans in four income levels. These income levels represent 
                the jobs that have a weekly income under the first quartile (Low), between the first quartile and median income (Mid-Low), between the 
                median the the third quartile (Mid-High), and above the third quartile (High). 
            </p>


            <div class="select">
                <select id="select">
                <option value="Year">Select Year</option>
                <option value="2024">2024</option>
                <option value="2023">2023</option>
                <option value="2022">2022</option>
                <option value="2021">2021</option>
                <option value="2020">2020</option>
                </select>
            </div>

            <div id="quadrantbar"></div>

            <p>From this visual we can see that Black Americans are statistically more likely to be overrepresented in lower paying jobs
                and underrepresented in higher paying jobs. This could be a result of the lack of education or the systemic impact of 
                steering Black Americans to more service oriented jobs. (add source for data and this idea)
