            <h2>The Gap in Wealth Ownership</h2>

            <p>Each square represents one household in America by the racial identity of those living in the household.</p>
            <div id="squares"></div>

            <p id="black-breakdown">As we add more squares, we start to build the racial breakdown of households in America. In 2024, Black Americans made up 11% of the households in America.</p>
            <div id="racial-breakdown"></div>

            <p>In a perfect world, each household would have an equal amount of wealth held from America's economy. This would look something like this...</p>
            <div id="equal-breakdown"></div>

              <button id="reset-square-equal">Click To Reset</button>
            </div>

            <p>However, we do not live in a perfect world. Wealth is unequally distributed to the population which puts Black Americans at a severe
                disadvantage regarding generational wealth. In reality, some races hold more wealth than propoptional to their population. The distribution of wealth looks more like this...</p>

              <button id="reset-square-unequal">Click To Reset</button>
            </div>

            
            <p>Black Americans are continuing to experience a gap in generational wealth. There are trends showing that Black Americans don't own wealth proportional to their population. We can see
                evidence of this in the graphics below. The left side shows the racial breakdown by household. The 
                right side shows the racial breakdown by household of wealth ownership. Click on the dropdown

                <h2>Why Does the Wealth Gap Exist?</h2>

                <h3>Disparity in Higher Education</h3>
                
                <p>In many cases, higher paying professional careers are obtained by pursuing higher education. However, Black people generally have less access
                  to higher education, which causes them to be underrepresented in higher paying fields. Below is a piechart that shows the breakdown of
                  education attainment by race in adults aged 25 and older. Compared to their White and Asian counterparts, Black people are less likely to receive
                  some sort of college degree.
                </p>

              <h3>Disparity in Incarceration Rates</h3>
              <p>Another cause of the diverging wealth gap is the incarceration rate of Black Americans compared to other races. This disproportional rate
                decreases the amount of working Black Americans, and consequentially, the amount of wealth Black Americans can hold. Each bar in the following graph represents
                the rate at which White Americans and Black Americans are incarcerated within each state. Click on each bar to view more details regarding the incarceration rates in each state.

              <div id="bar-chart"></div>

              <p>Interestingly, the states with lower Black populations experience this disparity at higher levels
                compared to states with more Black Americans. This disparity keeps
                Black Americans that are already low in population from creating generational wealth because of lower employment rates and
                higher incarceration numbers.

            <h2>Impact of Systemic Disparities on Employment</h2>

            <p>Since less Black Americans are pursuing higher education and are incarcerated at higher rates, we see a trend in the types of jobs
                Black Americans work. The visual below describes the under and overrepresentation of Black, White,
                Asian, and Hispanic Americans at four income levels. These income levels represent 
                the jobs that have a weekly income under the first quartile (Low), between the first quartile and median income (Mid-Low), between the 
                median the the third quartile (Mid-High), and above the third quartile (High). 
            </p>


            <p>From this visual we can see that Black Americans are statistically more likely to be overrepresented in lower paying jobs
              and underrepresented in higher paying jobs. This could be a result of the lack of education needed for such jobs, or the impact of society
              steering Black Americans to more service oriented jobs.
            </p>
            <div class="select">
                <select id="select">

                <option value="2022">2022</option>
                <option value="2021">2021</option>

                </select>
            </div>

            <div id="quadrantbar"></div>
            <p> The ratios for this data were calculated by dividing the race's representation in the specified jobs
              by the race's representation in the population. EX: If Black Americans made up 13% of the American population and 
              6% of the population of high-income jobs, this would calculate to 0.46. We then subtract that number from 
              1 which is our baseline and it gives us the ratio -0.53. Therefore Black Americans are underrepresented by a ratio
              of 0.53.
