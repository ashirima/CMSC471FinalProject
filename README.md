# The Cost of Being Black in America: Write-Up



## Wealth Gap Ownership Visualizations:

This section contains a series of visualizations that walk the reader through the analysis of the wealth gap for Black Americans. We used four different colors to represent the races White, Black, Hispanic, and other. We first show the racial breakdown of households in America, and then show the ideal distribution of wealth among the different races. Afterwards, we show the actual distribution of wealth so that audience can
easily compare the staggering differences between the two visualizations. Lastly, we show the racial breakdown of various wealth measures (mortgage and real estate) from 2020 to 2024 and compare it with the racial breakdown of households in the U.S. which clearly shows that Black households are at a disadvantage when it comes to holding wealth. 

## Educational Attainment Visualization:

This section explores a potential reason for why the wealth gap exists. We use two pie charts to show the education attainment rates by race in 2022. Since the graphs are interactive, viewers can change the race of each graph to compare two race’s education rates to compare them side by side. Each pie chart shows the percentage of people who obtained bachelor’s degrees or higher, associate’s degrees, high school diplomas only,
or no different diploma. The graphs show that Black Americans pursue higher education at lower rates compared to White people.

## Incarceration Rates Visualization:

This section features an interactive stacked bar chart that shows incarceration rates of Black and White people in all 50 states. The viewer can choose to look at data from 2019-2022 and choose to isolate the data by the states with the 10 lowest and 10 highest Black populations. Furthermore, the viewer can click each bar to reveal another visualization that creatively shows the difference in incarceration rates using squares and their sizes. 

## Salary Visualization:

This final section showcases the disparities Black Americans face in employment. We used a vertical bar chart to show the under and overrepresentation of White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic in four different salary areas. The graph is separated into four quadrants representing jobs with low, mid-low, mid-high, and high salaries. The further left the bar extends, the more underrepresented a race is, while the further right it extends, the more overrepresented a race is. The viewer can change the year to view graphs with data from 2020 to 2024. 

## Development Process:

At the start of the development process, we both found a bunch of potential datasets that we could use for this project, and over the course of a few days, narrowed it down to create 4 main sections. Abigail set up the repository, worked on the education attainment section, deployed the webpage, and recorded the demo video, and completed the write-up. She also edited all of the text on the webpage and helped Hadijat in the development process of the other sections. Hadijat worked on the wealth gap, incarceration rate, and employment sections by creating the visualizations. She also beautified the webpage and chose the color scheme.
